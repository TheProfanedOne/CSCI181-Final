                <p>
                    As you most likely know by now, my name is Matthew Mousseau. At the time of writing this bio,
                    I am twenty-one years old, and a freshman at Great Falls College Montana State University (GFCMSU).
                    My major is Computer Programming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on October 11th, 2001. After that, my family moved all
                    around the country every couple of years until 2008, when we moved to Great Falls, where we have
                    stayed ever since.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am diagnosed with High-Functioning-Autism and ADD, which severely hampers my ability to prioritize
                    tasks, engage in interpersonal communication, and generally pay attention to things. Despite this,
                    I am confident I will be able to push through these difficulties and conquer my disorders.

                <h1>My Education</h1>
                <p>
                    I attended middle school at Meadowlark Elementary School in Great Falls, Montana for my first through sixth
                    grade education. Upon graduating from elementary school, I moved on to North Middle School, also in
                    Great Falls, Montana, for my seventh and eighth grade classes. For my last four years of public education,
                    I attended CMR High School, once again in Great Falls, Montana, wherin I made sure to put lots of attention
                    on my sciences and maths, especially chemistry, to the point where I took and passed both the AP Calculus and
                    AP Chemistry Exams. Ironically, considering I am currently majoring in computer programming, I only took exactly
                    one computer science class throughout the entirety of my public education.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My first attempt at college education took place at Montana State University (MSU) in Bozeman. At that point
                    in time, I was a Chemistry Major. It didn't take long for me to realize that the only reason I liked chemistry
                    so much back in high school was because my high school chemistry teacher was absolutely incredible. The
                    disillusionment with my choice of major combined with the absolutely catastrophic mess the pandemic made of
                    MSU unfortunately cut my time there short, and I withdrew before the end of the semester and came back home to
                    Great Falls to try again there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, at GFCMSU, where I am doing something I actually enjoy (computer programming), I am doing much better, and I
                    hope to obtain my degree here.
